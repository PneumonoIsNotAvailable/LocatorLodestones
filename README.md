Adds Waypoints to the Player Locator Bar for each Lodestone Compass in your inventory.

The mod works entirely client-side, and doesn't need to be installed on the server.

If the lodestone compass has an RGB code in its name (for example, a compass named "Home #00FF8F"),
it will use that color for the waypoint.
Otherwise, the color is randomly determined based on the coordinates of the lodestone.

The names of lodestone compasses (minus any RGB codes) can be shown above the bar by holding down the player list key (by default TAB)

The mod also checks Bundles, so you can place all of your Lodestone Compasses in a Bundle, and it will still work.
